ZendFramework Application Installer For Koding.com


This is a deep hack of WordPressInstaller For Koding coded by "Gökmen Göksel", even didn't touch css class names.

Because of [this bug](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/1270) we cannot use composer at Koding shell


Todo
========
Add htaccess for rewriting
Add composer support
Add ZF Modules Importer [see](http://framework.zend.com/downloads/composer)
